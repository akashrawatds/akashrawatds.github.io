•	Building an image classification model by creating the data dictionary and classification rules.
•	Handling the classification and updating the rules and results by front end UI with Flask.
•	Create dataset over which machine learning model can be trained for classification.
•	Classification of single/multiple page documents based on their category with ML and without ML approach.
•	Extracting entity information from documents using NLTK and Spacy NLP libraries.
•	Building Spell checker module which corrects the incorrect spellings when image converted to text file with OCR using deep learning.
•	Deploying the model into production environment using Flask.

•	Data Manipulation/Cleaning of txt, XML, json, PDF and .msg files with Pandas/Python.
•	Analyzing data using descriptive statistics to get the data insights and data distribution.
•	Automated the data ingestion pipeline to execute data pre-processing steps with
•	configurable rules which can be handled from UI using Flask.
•	Machine Failure analysis by analyzing the machine failure probabilities using Imbalanced Classification.
•	Model deployment on an in premise IOT platform using Flask.

### Computer Vision

[Image Classification]
•	Built an Image classification model to classify images related to flow diagrams and logos.
•	Developed a web application in python Streamlit to visualize the extracted data from documents.
•	Developed an entity recognition model to extract the entities related to engg. domain.
•	Automated form filling activities by converting the non-editable PDF forms to editable PDF forms using computer vision.
