[Truck Driver Sentiment Analysis](/pdf/truck_driver_sentiment_analysis.pdf)
<br>
-	Building an image classification model by creating the data dictionary and classification rules.
-	Handling the classification and updating the rules and results by front end UI with Flask.
-	Create dataset over which machine learning model can be trained for classification.
-	Classification of single/multiple page documents based on their category with ML and without ML approach.
-	Extracting entity information from documents using NLTK and Spacy NLP libraries.
-	Building Spell checker module which corrects the incorrect spellings when image converted to text file with OCR using deep learning.
